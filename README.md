"# word_scraper" 

The program creates a bunch of lists to cross check a list containing all words from a specfied URL. 
after cross checking the URL list of words with the common words, nouns, verbs, and keywords, the URL list is
written to a text file and the found nouns and verbs are also written
to text files. These are stored in a unique directory each time the program is run. 

The user can spicfiy what URL to pull the text from in the main 
module. 

Future changes: 
- Add classes 
- Modularise the files correctly
- Add inheritance
- Create stronger regex functions
- More generic usability across various URLs
